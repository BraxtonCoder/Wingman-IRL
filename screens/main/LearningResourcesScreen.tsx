      "Focus on the Process, Not Outcome: The goal is to practice initiating, not necessarily to get a number every time. Each interaction is a learning experience.",

      "Reflect & Summarize: Briefly summarizing their points shows you understand and value their input.",

      "Offer to Connect (If appropriate and genuine): \"I'd love to continue this conversation sometime. Would you be open to exchanging numbers/socials?\"",

      "Be Respectful of Space: Don't be physically imposing. Approach from the side or front, not directly from behind.",
      "Keep it Light & Positive: Humor (if natural) and a friendly attitude go a long way.",
      "Genuine Compliments: If you offer a compliment, make it specific and sincere, focusing on something non-physical like their style, energy, or something they said.",
      "Accept Rejection Gracefully: Not every interaction will lead to a long conversation or a date. If she's not interested, respect that and move on politely. Don't take it personally."
